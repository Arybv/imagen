{"body":"![Example patterns](http://topographica.org/User_Manual/images/patterntypes_small.png)\r\n\r\nThe ImaGen package provides comprehensive support for creating resolution-independent one and two-dimensional spatial pattern distributions. ImaGen consists of a large library of primarily two-dimensional patterns, including mathematical functions, geometric primitives, images read from files, and many ways to combine or select from any other patterns. These patterns can be used in any Python program that needs configurable patterns or a series of patterns, with only a small amount of user-level code to specify or use each pattern.\r\n\r\n## Example usage\r\n\r\nRunning the following code in an `ipython -pylab` session generates two Gaussian patterns: \r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import imagen\r\n>>> pg=imagen.Gaussian(xdensity=60,ydensity=60,size=0.3,aspect_ratio=1.0)\r\n>>>\r\n>>> imshow(pg(),cmap=cm.gray,interpolation='nearest')\r\n>>> imshow(pg(size=0.5),cmap=cm.gray,interpolation='nearest')\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"5%\" src=\"http://topographica.org/User_Manual/images/gaussian_0.3.png\"  />\r\n<img width=\"5%\" src=\"http://topographica.org/User_Manual/images/gaussian_0.5.png\" />\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nImaGen requires NumPy (http://numpy.scipy.org/) and Param (http://ioam.github.com/param/).\r\n\r\nOfficial releases of ImaGen are available at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/imagen, and can be installed along with dependencies via `pip install imagen` or `easy_install imagen`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, after seperately installing the dependencies, ImaGen can be installed via `python setup.py install` (Windows users can download and run an exe from the preceding link).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nImaGen is currently being moved to github. Meanwhile, full documentation is available at the following links:\r\n\r\nUser manual and sample output: http://topographica.org/User_Manual/imagen.html\r\n\r\nReference manual: http://topographica.org/Reference_Manual/imagen-module.html\r\n\r\n\r\n## Support\r\nQuestions and comments are welcome at https://github.com/ioam/imagen/issues.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
