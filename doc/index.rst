Installation
============

ImaGen requires NumPy (http://numpy.scipy.org/), Param
(http://ioam.github.com/param/), and HoloViews
(http://ioam.github.com/holoviews/), none of which have any required
external dependencies.

Official releases of ImaGen are available at
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/imagen, and can be installed using ``pip``.  
If you don't have ``pip`` already, we recommend installing a
scientific Python distribution like 
`Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ first.  Then installation
of ImaGen and dependencies is simply::

  pip install imagen
