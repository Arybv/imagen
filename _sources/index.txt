Installation
============

ImaGen requires NumPy (http://numpy.scipy.org/), Param
(http://ioam.github.com/param/), and HoloViews
(http://ioam.github.com/holoviews/), none of which have any required
external dependencies.

Official releases of ImaGen are available at
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/imagen, and can be installed using ``pip``.  
If you don't have ``pip`` already, we recommend installing a
scientific Python distribution like 
`Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ first.  Then installation
of ImaGen and dependencies is simply::

  pip install imagen

Once you've installed ImaGen, an easy way to get started is to launch
IPython Notebook::

  ipython notebook

Now you can download the `tutorial notebooks
<Tutorials/imagen-notebooks-2.0.0.zip>`_, unzip them somewhere IPython
Notebook can find them, and then open the index.ipynb tutorial in the
Notebook.  Then try out any of the patterns you like, using
``help(``*obj-or-class*``)`` to find out its parameters and their
options, or repeatedly press ``<Shift+TAB>`` in IPython after opening
an object constructor.  Note that IPython notebook is not in any way
required for ImaGen, but it does provide a very handy way to visualize
and explore the patterns interactively even if you will eventually use
them separately from IPython.
